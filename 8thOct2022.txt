How do we build a dataset, when there is no data available?

The terminology we are using is this:
    "Routine": A 21 day program.
    "DayTraining (DT)": 1 day's exercise.
    "Phase": Each DT contains 3 phases (Warmup, Workout, Cooldown)

An approach we came up with was to give an "intensity" attribute to each exercise.

The value of the attribute would range from 0.0-0.5, 0.5 being the highest intensity. 

For each DT, the combined intensity of all the exercises will be 1. 

Each exercise will have multiple values for the "goal" attribute.

1. Build an engine which will assign routines to users based on
   the below "algorithm":
        i) User inputs parameters [Weight, Height, Age, Gender, 
           Activity Level]. The program will calculate BMI from
           weight, height etc.
        ii) Each exercise will have an "intensity" attribute 
            assigned to it. (Ranging from 0-1). For each DT, 
            the combined intensity of all exercises will be 3
            (1 for warmup, 1 for workout, 1 for cooldown).
        iii)

ML MODEL

1. Online Learning:
       One important parameter of online learning systems is how fast they should adapt to
changing data: this is called the learning rate. If you set a high learning rate, then your
system will rapidly adapt to new data, but it will also tend to quickly forget the old
data (you donâ€™t want a spam filter to flag only the latest kinds of spam it was shown).
Conversely, if you set a low learning rate, the system will have more inertia; that is, it
will learn more slowly, but it will also be less sensitive to noise in the new data or to
sequences of nonrepresentative data points (outliers) 


MAKE COMBINATIONS OF DAY TRAININGS.
